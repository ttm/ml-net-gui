Welcome to the Gradus.

In this page, keep track of the "tips" until you reach your own social structure.
You will make audiovisual music with it in order to acquire intimacy with the framework.

Then, there will be other interfaces for community detection, synchronization and diffusion,
merging structures, and other functionalities.
Hope you reach the interaction networks from Twitter, Instagram, and other communication platforms.

Good luck.

Welcome to Lycoreia.

In this page, you see the communities and subcommunitites of your networks.

You may keep the exibition of communitites in sequence by hitting the "rotate communities" button.
Similar to subcommunitites.

Record three network music pieces, upload video and input URLs into your repertoire.
You will then have access to the synchronization page.

Welcome to Tithorea.

You can understand your interaction with your networks
as exploration:
  . with analyzis; or with
  . midia generation / absorption,
or as synergy:
  . by diffusion; or by
  . syncronization.

Synchronization meaning a process in which you have
an expected (or idealized) result, such as maturing a concept or framework,
building a community, getting a project done, having an event happen.

A diffusion is most often a synchronization: you want feedback messages,
you want to create derivatives.
A synchronization most often involves a fund, a monetary crowdsourcing (crowdfunding).
A synchronization often involves an information crowdsourcing, for example
to mature an idea, to find partners or sponsors, to understand how a proposal is accepted.

The diffusion of goods may be essentially a diffusion (e.g. selling a product),
although it most often is a synchronization (e.g. a community of buyers).

In this page, you design a network synchronization.
After three musical pieces input, you will be able to perform one and only network synchronization.
This is your utmost goal at this stage.
